# Manual Migration Setup - Summary

## ✅ What's Changed

1. **Removed build-time migrations** from Dockerfile
2. **Added migration API endpoints** to main.py:
   - `POST /admin/migrate` - Run migrations manually
   - `GET /admin/migration-status` - Check migration status
   - `GET /admin` - Admin panel UI
3. **Simplified cloudbuild.yaml** - No build args needed
4. **Your existing GitHub trigger** will continue to work for deployments

## 🚀 Deployment Process

### Automatic Deployment (GitHub Push)
1. Push code to `main` branch
2. Cloud Build automatically builds and deploys
3. Your app is live but **migrations are NOT run**

### Manual Migration
After deployment, run migrations manually:

```bash
# Using your deployed service URL
curl -X POST https://your-service-url/admin/migrate

# Check migration status
curl https://your-service-url/admin/migration-status
```

## 🔧 Admin Panel

Visit `/admin` on your deployed service for a web UI to:
- Check migration status
- Run migrations with confirmation
- Check application health

## 🖼️ Image Storage

The app now uses **Google Cloud Storage** for storing uploaded inventory images:
- **Environment Variable**: `GCS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name`
- **Storage Path**: `inventory/{provider_id}/{inventory_id}.jpg`
- **Public URLs**: `https://storage.googleapis.com/your-bucket/...`
- **Authentication**: Automatic on Cloud Run (service account)

## 📋 Local Testing

Your local endpoints (port 8001):
- http://localhost:8001/admin - Admin panel
- http://localhost:8001/admin/migrate - Run migrations
- http://localhost:8001/admin/migration-status - Check status
- http://localhost:8001/health - Health check

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✅ **Fast deployments** (no migration delays)
- ✅ **Full control** over when migrations run
- ✅ **Production safety** (can run migrations on live system)
- ✅ **Easy monitoring** via API endpoints
- ✅ **Web interface** for non-technical users
